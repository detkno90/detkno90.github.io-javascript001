javascript challenge


This project is slightly different from others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use Codecademy, the internet, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve. In order to complete this project, you should have completed the first three sections of Introduction to JavaScript through Learn JavaScript: Functions.
